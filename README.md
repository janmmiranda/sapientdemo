1. You have to maintain the assessment scores of trainees in a batch, and rate them based on the scores. There are different types of assessments – online, coding and class performance. Different weightage will be given to the different assessments and final score will be calculated. Rating will be given based on the final score. Trainee information and scores will be saved in database.

2. You have to design an application that presents a quiz and grades user’s responses. A quiz consists of questions. There can be different kinds of questions:
    Fill-in-the-blank
    Choice (single or multiple)
    Numeric (where an approximate answer is ok, e.g., 1.33 or 4/3)
Design the classes for the above. You need to design the classes only and not the user interface for taking the test.
