1. You have to maintain the assessment scores of trainees in a batch, and rate them based on the scores. There are different types of assessments – online, coding and class performance. Different weightage will be given to the different assessments and final score will be calculated. Rating will be given based on the final score. Trainee information and scores will be saved in database.

2. You have to design an application that presents a quiz and grades user’s responses. A quiz consists of questions. There can be different kinds of questions:<br />
    Fill-in-the-blank<br />
    Choice (single or multiple)<br />
    Numeric (where an approximate answer is ok, e.g., 1.33 or 4/3)<br />
Design the classes for the above. You need to design the classes only and not the user interface for taking the test.

3. Your application needs a number sequence and there can be different kinds of sequences, like a sequence of random numbers, prime numbers, squares, odd numbers, etc. Different scenarios may use different sequences. A sequence generator should accept the kind of sequence and number of values in sequence and generate and display the sequence.<br />
Design and implement the classes that you will be need to achieve the above. Use a test class to test the generation of the different number sequences.

4.  You have to design an application for a user holding a Bank Account. Following are the requirements:
        There can be different kinds of bank accounts.
        The checking account has no interest, gives you a small number of free transactions per month, and charges a transaction fee for each additional transaction.
        The savings account earns interest that compounds monthly. The interest will be computed on the minimum balance for the month.
        The fees will be deducted from CheckingAccount at end of month.
        Interest on SavingsAccount will be added at end of month.
        There should be a custom exception when the account is constructed with a negative balance, when a negative amount is deposited, or when an amount that is not between 0 and the current balance is withdrawn.

Design classes for the above.
